Welcome To J~Net Dynamic Pad For Encrypting / Decrypting With OneTime 2020 Menu

https://jnet.forumotion.com/t1709-one-time-pads-for-linux-bash-tut#2649

sudo chmod +x *.sh

./menu.sh

When asked put filename of file you want to encrypt and then you will need to export the cipher and otp.txt to be decrypted later!

Every file uses a new one time pad so all pads and ciphers should be kept seperate and removed when not required anymore!
